/**
 * The ActionType is used to provide a string name to each action
 * and is also the key needed to retrieve an action by name.
 * 
 * Each action has an associated sensactActionID.  This is the ID for the 
 * action taken by the Sensact and this must be in sync with the Sensact code.
 * In some cases several actions listed here have the same sensactActionID.
 * This is because different UIs are needed for different facets of the
 * action.  e.g. The UI to enter a letter (a text box) is different from the
 * UI to select a special key (a combo box) but both result in a keyboard
 * action with an appropriate key code on the Sensact.
