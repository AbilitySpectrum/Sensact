# Port should be all or part of the descriptive string for the
# port.  Leonardo is a good default, but this may not work if 
# drivers are not installed.  If the name does not match any
# existing ports a dialog will appear showing which ports are
# available, allowing you to choose.  You can then come here
# and set the word or words to be matched for proper port selection.
