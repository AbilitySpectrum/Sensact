Installation Requirements for SensAct Config programs (python version)

Getting Python
==============
Sensact config requires python 3 to run (not python 2).

If you do not have python on your machine you can download it
from: www.python.org.

If you have python but are unsure which version you have type:

	python -V
	
(that is a capital 'v')

The python version number reported needs to be more than 3.4.

If you are using a Raspberry Pi be aware that the Pi often has both
python 2 and python 3 installed.  Python version three is accessed
with the command:
	python3
	
Getting PySerial
================
The PySerial package must be added to your python installation to
allow for serial port access.  Version 3.3 or higher is required.

References here to 'python' should be replaced with 'python3' on the PI.

To find out if you have PySerial and which version you have run:
	python.  

At the prompt enter 'import serial':
	>>> import serial
	
Then enter 'serial.VERSION'
	>>> serial.VERSION
	
Then exit the python program. (^Z on linux)

If you do not have PySerial at all you can get it with the command:
	python -m pip install pyserial

If you have PySerial but it is an older version you can upgrade
with:
	python(3) -m pip install pyserial --upgrade
	
You may need to prefix this command with 'sudo' to get the permission
you need.
